# V2raySetUp 

# what is V2ray?
Project V is a set of tools to help you build your own privacy network over internet. The core of Project V, named V2Ray, is responsible for network protocols and communications. It can work alone, as well as combine with other tools.

# Features
<ol>
  <li>Multiple inbound/outbound proxies: one V2Ray instance supports in parallel multiple inbound and outbound protocols. Each protocol works independently.</li>
  <li>Customizable routing: incoming traffic can be sent to different outbounds based on routing configuration. It is easy to route traffic by target region or domain.</li>
  <li>Multiple protocols: V2Ray supports multiple protocols, including Socks, HTTP, Shadowsocks, VMess etc. Each protocol may have its own transport, such as TCP, mKCP, WebSocket etc.</li>
  <li>Obfuscation: V2Ray has built in obfuscation to hide traffic in TLS, and can run in parallel with web servers.</li>
  <li>Reverse proxy: General support of reverse proxy. Can be used to build tunnels to localhost.</li>
  <li>Multiple platforms: V2Ray runs natively on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc. There is also third party support on mobile.</li>
</ol>

#how it works?

(Client) <-> [ Bridge Server ] <-> [ Upstream Server ] <-> (Internet)

Bridge Server ~ a server in iran
Upstream Server ~ a server in foreign country which has access to free internet



# V2ray deploying methods
### method 1 (using docker compose of v2ray)[recommended]:
# V2Ray Docker Compose

This repository contains sample Docker Compose files to run V2Ray upstream and bridge servers.

## Documentation

### Terminology

* Upstream Server: A server that has free access to the Internet.
* Bridge Server: A server that is available to clients and has access to the upstream server.
* Client: A user-side application with access to the bridge server.

```
(Client) <-> [ Bridge Server ] <-> [ Upstream Server ] <-> (Internet)
```

### Setup

#### Upstream Server

1. Install Docker and Docker-compose.
1. Copy the `v2ray-upstream-server` directory into the upstream server.
1. Run ```cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid``` command to generate a UUID.
1. Replace `<UPSTREAM-UUID>` in the `config.json` file with the generated UUID.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`.

#### Bridge Server

1. Install Docker and Docker-compose.
1. Copy the `v2ray-bridge-server` directory into the bridge server.
1. Replace the following variables in the `config.json` file with appropriate values.
    * `<BRIDGE-UUID>`: A new UUID for bridge server (Run ```cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid```).
    ```javascript
  "inbounds": [
    {
      "listen": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 1310,
      "protocol": "vmess",
      "settings": {
        "clients": [
          {
            "id": "<BRIDGE-UUID>",
            "alterId": 0,
            "security": "aes-128-gcm"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
```
    * `<UPSTREAM-IP>`: The upstream server IP address like `13.13.13.13`.
    * `<UPSTREAM-UUID>`: The generated UUID for the upstream server.
        ```javascript
"outbounds": [
    {
      "tag": "proxy",
      "protocol": "vmess",
      "settings": {
        "vnext": [
          {
            "address": "<UPSTREAM-IP>",
            "port": 1310,
            "users": [
              {
                "id": "<UPSTREAM-UUID>",
                "alterId": 0,
                "security": "none"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
    ```
    
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`. 
1. You can run `./clients.py` to generate client configurations and links.

1.run in both servers wget -N --no-check-certificate https://github.com/teddysun/across/raw/master/bbr.sh && chmod +x bbr.sh && bash bbr.sh


#### Clients

##### VMESS Protocol

The VMESS proxy protocol is the primary protocol that V2Ray servers provide.
We recommend these client applications:
* [V2RayX for macOS](https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/releases)
* [v2ray-core for Linux](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core)
* [Qv2ray for Windows](https://qv2ray.net)
* [ShadowLink for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shadowlink-shadowsocks-vpn/id1439686518)
* [v2rayNG for Android](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG)
    
    
### method 2 (using docker compose + x-ui):
#how it works?

(Client) <-> [ Bridge Server(x-ui) ] <-> [ Upstream Server(docker compose) ] <-> (Internet)

### Setup

#### Upstream Server

1. Install Docker and Docker-compose.
1. Copy the `v2ray-upstream-server` directory into the upstream server.
1. Run ```cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid``` command to generate a UUID.
1. Replace `<UPSTREAM-UUID>` in the `config.json` file with the generated UUID.
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`.

#### Bridge Server
it supports vmess縲」less縲》rojan縲《hadowsocks縲‥okodemo-door縲《ocks縲”ttp

-intsalling x-ui:
1. bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaxilu/x-ui/master/install.sh)
1. press n and enter in question(in chinese)
1. open ur webbrowser go to <bridge server>:54321
1. user & pass = admin
1. DO NOT forget to change user&pass
1. now config x-ui outbounds manuaaly (only <UPSTREAM-IP>,<UPSTREAM-PORT>,<UPSTREAM-UUID> in outbounds part)
